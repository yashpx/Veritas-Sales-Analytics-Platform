Sales Rep (Alex): Hey John, great to connect again. How’s your week going so far?

Prospect (John): Hey Alex, it’s been good—busy, but good.

Sales Rep (Alex): I hear you. Appreciate you making the time. I want to make the most of it, so my goal today is to really understand your team’s sales process, the challenges you’re facing, and see if we can help. Does that sound good?

Prospect (John): Yeah, sounds good.

Sales Rep (Alex): Awesome. So, I know Acme Solutions is growing fast. Can you walk me through your sales team setup—how many reps, and how you’re currently managing sales calls?

Prospect (John): Sure. We’ve got 20 reps right now, mainly doing outbound, and we use HubSpot as our CRM.

Sales Rep (Alex): Got it. And when it comes to tracking rep performance and call effectiveness, what’s your current approach?

Prospect (John): Honestly, it’s a mix. Reps take their own notes, and managers review deals manually. We try to do weekly call coaching, but it’s hard to stay consistent.

Sales Rep (Alex): Makes sense. A lot of teams we work with struggle with that—manual notes can be incomplete, and coaching often becomes reactive instead of proactive. Would you say missed insights or rep consistency is the bigger issue right now?

Prospect (John): Probably consistency. Some reps are great, others struggle, and it’s tough to pinpoint why.

Sales Rep (Alex): Got it. So ideally, you’d want a way to surface what’s working for top reps and replicate that across the team?

Prospect (John): Exactly.

Sales Rep (Alex): That’s a common challenge. Out of curiosity, how much time do managers currently spend reviewing calls and coaching?

Prospect (John): Probably too much. Each manager has about five reps, and they try to review one or two calls per week per rep, but it’s hard to keep up.

Sales Rep (Alex): Right. So in a perfect world, you’d want a system that automatically flags key moments, so managers know exactly which calls to review and what to coach on?

Prospect (John): Yeah, that would be a game changer.

Sales Rep (Alex): Got it. Another thing I hear from sales leaders is that reps sometimes forget to log key details in the CRM, making it hard to track deal progress. Is that something you run into?

Prospect (John): All the time. Some reps are great at note-taking, but others barely put anything in.

Sales Rep (Alex): Makes sense. If I’m hearing you right, the big priorities are improving rep consistency, making coaching more efficient, and ensuring better data in your CRM. Anything else?

Prospect (John): That’s pretty much it.

Sales Rep (Alex): Perfect. Based on what you’ve shared, this is exactly where RevSync helps. Our platform automatically records and transcribes calls, highlights key moments—like objections or pricing discussions—and delivers instant insights to managers. So instead of sifting through calls, they can jump straight to the most important parts.

Prospect (John): Hmm. So this would eliminate the need for reps to take notes?

Sales Rep (Alex): Exactly. Our system automatically captures action items, next steps, and even buyer sentiment—so reps can focus on selling, not note-taking. And everything syncs into HubSpot automatically.

Prospect (John): That’s interesting. How does it identify coaching opportunities?

Sales Rep (Alex): Great question. The AI tracks talk-to-listen ratios, objection handling, competitor mentions, and even customer engagement levels. It then flags areas where reps might need coaching—so instead of guessing, managers can focus on the biggest impact areas.

Prospect (John): That would definitely help.

Sales Rep (Alex): Exactly. Plus, since all the data is centralized, you can start to see trends—like which talk tracks close the most deals or where deals tend to stall. That way, you’re not just improving individual reps, but the entire sales process.

Prospect (John): Yeah, that’s valuable. But what about security? We deal with a lot of sensitive client information.

Sales Rep (Alex): Totally valid concern. RevSync is fully SOC 2 and GDPR compliant, with end-to-end encryption. You also have full control over which calls are recorded and who can access them.

Prospect (John): Got it. What’s implementation like? We don’t have time for a long setup.

Sales Rep (Alex): Totally understand. The good news is, RevSync is plug-and-play. Since you’re already using HubSpot, setup takes about 30 minutes. And we provide onboarding to make sure your team is up and running fast.

Prospect (John): That’s good to know.

Sales Rep (Alex): So, based on what we’ve covered—does this sound like something worth exploring in more detail?

Prospect (John): Yeah, I think so.

Sales Rep (Alex): Awesome. Let’s set up a quick demo so I can walk you through how this would look with your actual workflow. I have a slot Thursday at 10 AM or Friday at 2 PM. Which works better?

Prospect (John): Let’s do Friday at 2.

Sales Rep (Alex): Perfect. I’ll send over a calendar invite along with a short video overview so you can get a preview. I’ll also loop in Sarah, your RevOps lead—sound good?

Prospect (John): Yeah, that works.

Sales Rep (Alex): Awesome. Looking forward to it, John. Appreciate your time today!

Prospect (John): Thanks, Alex. See you Friday.
