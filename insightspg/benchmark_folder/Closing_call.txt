Sales Rep (Sophie): Hey Matt, thanks again for taking the time to chat today. I just want to quickly recap where we’ve been and make sure everything is in place to move forward.

Prospect (Matt): Yeah, sounds good.

Sales Rep (Sophie): So, over the last few calls, we’ve covered how RevSync can help your team with sales consistency, coaching efficiency, and real-time insights into performance. We’ve talked about how the AI highlights key moments in calls and provides data-backed coaching opportunities, which will save your managers hours each week.

Prospect (Matt): Right, and I like that. The data-backed coaching part really spoke to me.

Sales Rep (Sophie): That’s great to hear! And I know you’ve been particularly concerned about getting your team onboarded quickly and seamlessly. We’ve also talked about how RevSync integrates easily with your existing CRM—so no disruptions there.

Prospect (Matt): Yes, that’s something I was worried about at first, but I’m glad it’s all seamless.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Exactly. And in terms of your team’s training, we’ll ensure everyone’s fully up to speed with our onboarding sessions and customer support. Plus, we offer lifetime access to our resource center, so your team can always reference guides and videos when needed.

Prospect (Matt): I feel good about that.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Awesome. Now, I understand you had some lingering concerns about pricing, particularly whether the ROI justifies the investment.

Prospect (Matt): Yeah, that’s been on my mind.

Sales Rep (Sophie): I totally get that. Let me walk you through how we’ve seen our customers’ ROI unfold after implementing RevSync. On average, they see a 20-30% improvement in rep productivity and a 15% increase in conversion rates within the first three months. And since the platform reduces the time managers spend on reviewing calls, they can focus on higher-value tasks.

Prospect (Matt): Those are strong numbers.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Absolutely. To give you an example, one of our clients, a software company similar to yours, saw a 25% increase in overall sales in the first quarter after integrating RevSync. They were able to identify specific sales tactics that were underperforming and make quick adjustments.

Prospect (Matt): That’s exactly what we need.

Sales Rep (Sophie): I’m glad it aligns with your goals. Now, another thing I know you were considering was the pricing structure. I want to remind you that we offer flexible plans to suit your needs. If you’re ready to commit today, we can also offer a 10% discount on the annual subscription, which will save your team some budget and lock in the best rate.

Prospect (Matt): A discount would be great, but I’m still a little hesitant on some of the details.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Of course, I completely understand. Let’s address any last-minute concerns. Was it primarily the pricing that you’re concerned about, or are there any other barriers we should talk through?

Prospect (Matt): Mostly the pricing, and also whether this is going to be worth the investment long term.

Sales Rep (Sophie): I hear you, Matt. When you look at RevSync’s potential to save your managers hours each week while also improving the performance of your sales team, I think you’ll find it’s a strong investment. If you think about the value it’s going to bring—improving rep performance, reducing training time, and ultimately increasing your revenue—it pays for itself pretty quickly.

Prospect (Matt): Yeah, I see that now.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Exactly. And just to make sure you’re feeling confident moving forward, we’ll provide you with a success manager to work with your team directly during onboarding and beyond. You’ll never be left in the dark.

Prospect (Matt): That’s reassuring.

Sales Rep (Sophie): We’re really committed to helping you succeed long term. So, with everything lined up and the special offer in place today, does now feel like the right time to get started?

Prospect (Matt): Yeah, I think so. I’m ready to move forward.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Fantastic! I’m so glad to hear that, Matt. Let’s get the ball rolling. I’ll send over the contract for you to review and sign. Once that’s done, we can schedule your onboarding session and kick things off. Does that sound good?

Prospect (Matt): Yes, that works for me.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Great! I’ll also send over some materials to help you prep for the first session. You’ll have everything you need to hit the ground running.

Prospect (Matt): Awesome, I appreciate it.

Sales Rep (Sophie): You’re welcome, Matt! Just to confirm, I’ll be sending the contract over now, and once it’s signed, we can set the date for onboarding. We’re looking at a two-week turnaround for that, so your team will be up and running shortly.

Prospect (Matt): Perfect.

Sales Rep (Sophie): Thanks again for your trust, Matt. I’m really excited to see the results RevSync will bring to your team!

Prospect (Matt): Me too. Thanks for everything, Sophie.

Sales Rep (Sophie): You’re welcome! Talk soon.
